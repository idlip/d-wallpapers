* Bright wallpapers to light up your room

Use Dark-mode everywhere, but when it comes to wallpapers, Be smart and use Lighter ones.

**  You might want to look at my script [[https://github.com/idlip/d-bin/d-walls][d-walls]]

Which chooses random wallpaper from given directory and sets it as background wallpaper.

You can even make script to loop so it changes random wallpaper every hour or so...
